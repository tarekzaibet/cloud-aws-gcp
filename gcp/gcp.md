## Cloud Storage

### Buckets

- steps to create a bucket :
  - specify a globally unique name
  - choose a geographic location where your bucket and its content are stored
  - a default storage class : (The default storage class you choose applies to objects added to the bucket that don't have a storage class specified explicitly.)
- You can apply labels to a bucket (key:value). Each bucket has a maximum of 64 labels

### Objects

- There is no limit on the number of objects you can store in a bucket
- Objects has two components : object data & object metadata
- Object versioning : by default when you overwrite an object, Storage deletes the old version and replaces it with a new version, unless you enable object versioning. In this case when you delete an object, the object is identified with an older generation number, you can retrieve the version by its generation number.
- objects are immutable, objects cannot change throughout it's storage life time

### Geo-redundancy

- Geo-redundant data are stored in at least two separate geographic places separated by at least 100 miles.
- Objects stored in multi-regions and dual-regions are geo-redundant.  
- ensures HA of your data
- occurs asynchronously

### Storage Locations

- Use a region to help optimize latency and network bandwidth for data consumers, such as analytics pipelines, that are grouped in the same region.

- Use a dual-region when you want similar performance advantages as regions, but also want the higher availability that comes with being geo-redundant, A dual-region is a specific pair of regions, such as Finland and the Netherlands.

- Use a multi-region when you want to serve content to data consumers that are outside of the Google network and distributed across large geographic areas, or when you want the higher availability that comes with being geo-redundant.A multi-region is a large geographic area, such as the United States, that contains two or more geographic places.

- Objects stored in a multi-region or dual-region are geo-redundant.

### Storage Classes

- Standard storage :
  - best for short term objects and frequently accessed data
  - Minimum storage duration : None
  - SLA : >99.99% in multi-regions and dual-regions. 99.99% in regions
- Nearline storage :
  - best for backups and data accessed once a month or less
  - Minimum storage duration : 30 days
  - SLA : >99.95% in multi-regions and dual-regions. 99.9% in regions
- Coldline storage :
  - best for data recovery and data accessed once a year or less
  - Minimum storage duration : 90 days
  - SLA : >99.95% in multi-regions and dual-regions. 99.9% in regions

### Object Lifecyle Management

- you can set these conditions on an object :
    - age
    - createdbefore
    - matches storage class
    - number of newer versions

- you can set these actions on an object :
   - Delete
   - set storage class

- when you change a configuration, it takes place 24 hours later

### Object versioning

- You enable Object Versioning for a bucket. Once enabled, Cloud Storage creates an archived version of an object each time the live version of the object is overwritten or deleted. The archived version retains the name of the object but is uniquely identified by a generation number. While all objects have generation numbers associated with them, only archived objects require generation numbers in order to identify them.

### Encryption  

- Google managed encryption keys : Cloud Storage manages server-side encryption keys on your behalf using the same hardened key management systems that we use for our own encrypted data, including strict key access controls and auditing. Cloud Storage encrypts user data at rest using AES-256
- Customer supplied encryption keys : As an additional layer on top of Google-managed encryption keys, you can choose to provide your own AES-256 key, encoded in standard Base64.
- Customer managed encryption keys : As an additional layer on top of Google-managed encryption keys, you can choose to use keys generated by Cloud Key Management Service. Such keys are known as customer-managed encryption keys. If you use a customer-managed encryption key, your encryption keys are stored within Cloud KMS. The project that holds your encryption keys can then be independent from the project that contains your buckets, thus allowing for better separation of duties.
- Client side keys :When you perform client-side encryption, you must create and manage your own encryption keys, and you must use your own tools to encrypt data prior to sending it to Cloud Storage

## Cloud SQL

- fully managed relational database, you can choose mySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL server as db engine. Google handles replication, patch management and database management to ensure availability and performance.
